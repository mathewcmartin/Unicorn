# Project Unicorn


## Goal 
Create an attractive background for modular use on websites, specifically for my portfolio to represent my appreciation, for and of, aesthetics in coding.


## Styleguide


* Grey Scale for proof of concept and initial testing
* Color and Detail in final product
* Background is intended to be static
* Transparent Cloud layers should be sandwiched between mountain layers and background
* Cloud Layers move ‘fast’ horizontally
* Mountain Layers move ‘slow’ horizontally
* A viewport smaller than the image’s width should allow horizontal travel without finding an edge of the image.


## jQuery
Along with HTML and CSS, jQuery is intended to add the animation of the layers as ```<div>```s using jQuery's .animate() function. 


## Credits
This project was inspired by the open scene of “Princess Mononoke”, a film directed by Hayao Miyazaki. A beautiful moving landscape with clouds lending depth and perspective as the camera scrolls down from the horizon to the foreground. Credit should be given that works vision in inspiring beauty and wisdom thru storytelling, lending light to the shared human struggle.
